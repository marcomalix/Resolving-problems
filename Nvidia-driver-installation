# Steps to setup the Nvidia driver
# By default the intel graphic card is used, it consums less power (battery) and do the job


# Install Nvidia driver (v470.63.1 in my case [Geforce 920MX])

sudo pacman -S nvidia

# PRIME render offload - method to use nvidia card on demand

# 1/ install nvidia-prime
# 2/ install glxinfo

# To run a program on the NVIDIA card you can use the prime-run script provided by nvidia-prime:

prime-run glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"
prime-run kdenlive # (any program you want to lunch using nvdia card, in this exemple it's kdenlive)
