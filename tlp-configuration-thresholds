# tlp-configuration-thresholds #
# Intervalle de recharge de la batterie en utilisant tlp

#1/ vérifier si tlp est installé et activé 

tlp-stat -s

#2/ Consult the output of 

tlp-stat -b

# - tlp setcharge validates parameters and configuration and reports errors

# - A value of 0 is translated to the vendor specific default (or the disabled state)

# - If the laptop supports only a stop charge threshold, use START_CHARGE_THRESH = 0

# Go to: /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode 
# and switch to 1 to enable conservation mode or 0 to disable it

# Go to /etc/tlp.conf, look for # Battery Care -- Charge thresholds and make 
# under BAT0 (which is the main battery):

START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=0 # 0 because my laptop supports only START_CHARGE_THRESH (verified in the output of tlp-stat -b)
STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=60 # 60 because my lenovo is autoprogrammed to stop charge at 60%

# Finally run: 

tlp setcharge
